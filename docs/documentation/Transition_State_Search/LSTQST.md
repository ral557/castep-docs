## Theory
The linear synchronous transit / quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method is a useful method for finding transition states in simple energy landscapes.

It is a close-ended search, meaning that both the initial (reactant) and final (product) states have to be provided. The LST part of the transition state search linearly interpolates  between
the reactant and product, before performing an SCF calculation of the energy of several intermediate strutures. This is used to
